In this assignment we would like you to write a script to achieve one small basic task using wav2vec
2.0
1. Run an audio of length more than 15 mins using wav2vec framework [GitHub -
pytorch/fairseq: Facebook AI Research Sequence-to-Sequence Toolkit written in Python.].
Notes:
• You can only use pytorch fairseq gitcode at its core and not any of its modification.
• You are allowed to use any third-party lib to process/transform the audio before it is feed to
neural network.
• Run code of pretrained librispeech model available in the same git repo.
