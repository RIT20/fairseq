HELLO EVERYONE THIS IS JANEED HERE FROM
EDURAKA AND I WELCOME YOU ALL TO THIS
INTERESTING SESSION
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO TURN ANY IMAGE
THAT WE GIVE INTO A CARTOONS
SO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO LET ME
QUICKLY WALK YOU THROUGH TODAY'S AGENDA
WE'LL START THIS SESSION BY
UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE ITS WORKFLOW
FOLLOWING THAT I'LL BE WALKING YOU
THROUGH THE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND
FRAMEWORKS THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE
AND FINALLY WE'LL START BUILDING UP THIS
PROJECT ALL RIGHT SO BEFORE WE BEGIN DO
CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TO OUR YOUTUBE
CHANNEL AND HIT THE BELL ICON TO STAY
UPDATED ON TRENDING TECHNOLOGIES
AND ALSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD FOR
PYTHON TRAINING CERTIFICATION PLEASE
CHECK OUT THE LINK GIVEN IN THE
DESCRIPTION BOX BELOW
ALL RIGHT GUYS COMING BACK TO OUR
PROJECT RIGHT SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE
GONNA DO HERE
WELL YOU SEE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
THESE FILTERS RIGHT LIKE ANYTHING ON
SNAPCHAT OR WE ALSO HAVE THIS PIXAR
WHEREIN WE PROVIDE ANY INPUT IMAGE AND
YOU KNOW WE GET THIS EDGES AND IT'S
SOMETHING WE ARE TRYING TO CARTONIFY THE
IMAGE
SO SIMILAR THING IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DO HERE USING PYTHON
AND THE LIBRARY THAT I'M GOING TO USE
OVER HERE IS GOING TO BE OPENCV ALL
RIGHT
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STEPS THAT WE
ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THAT IS GOING TO BE
FIRST OFF LOAD OUR IMAGE THEN CREATE AN
EDGE MASK
THEN WE GO TO YOU KNOW REDUCE THE NOISE
AND ALL SO ON AND SO FORTH
SO LET'S NOW MOVE AHEAD AND SEE WHAT
WOULD BE ITS UH THE WORKFLOW
OKAY FIRST OFF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
OVER HERE IS LOAD OUR IMAGE
SO THE IMAGE CAN BE ANY IMAGE I WOULD
SAY YOU KNOW IT'S BETTER TO TAKE IMAGE
OF A HUMAN
AND THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE
GOING TO CREATE A MASK FOLLOWED BY
REDUCTION OF NOISE
MOVING AHEAD THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
IS REDUCE THE COLOR PALETTE OVER HERE
WHAT DOES THIS COLOR PALETTE MEAN IS
LET'S SAY I JUST WANT TO CREATE A
CARTOON WHICH HAS ONLY FOUR NUMBER OF
COLORS RIGHT SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO
AND FINALLY WE ARE GOING TO COMBINE OUR
EDGE MASK AND COLOR PALETTE IN ORDER TO
CREATE A CARTOON OF ANY GIVEN IMAGE OVER
HERE
SO WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND
FRAMEWORKS THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE SO
TO START OFF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS
WE ARE GOING TO USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
ALL RIGHT AND THE MAJOR LIBRARY OR THE
IMPORTANT LIBRARY THAT WE'RE GOING TO
USE OVER HERE IS GOING TO BE OPENCV 2
ALL RIGHT AND THEN AS YOU ALL KNOW
COUPLE OF STANDARD LIBRARIES THAT WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE IS MATPLOTLIB AND NUMPY
AND BEFORE YOU MOVE AHEAD GUYS THE
KNOWLEDGE ON PYTHON IS PRETTY ESSENTIAL
HERE AND IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO IS
TOTALLY NEW TO PYTHON PLEASE CHECK OUT
THE PYTHON FULL COURSE LINK
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN IN THE DESCRIPTION
BOX BELOW SO NOW THAT WE KNOW A BIT
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT WE
ARE GOING TO WORK ON LET ME QUICKLY JUMP
TO MY CODE EDITOR AND SHOW YOU HOW WE
CAN BUILD THIS INTERESTING PROJECT ALL
RIGHT SO HERE WE ARE THIS IS MY VISUAL
STUDIO CODE
ALL RIGHT AND NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
IS FIRST OFF WE'LL TRY TO WRITE DOWN THE
STEPS OKAY LET ME
OR BEFORE THAT WHAT WE'LL DO IS LET'S
TRY TO IMPORT LIBRARIES FIRST
SO WE HAVE IMPORT CV2
THEN WE ALSO NEED IMPORT NUMPY
AS NP THEN WE HAVE IMPORT
MATPLOTLIB DOT PI PLOT
AS PLT ALL RIGHT AND LET'S NOW EXECUTE
THIS OVER HERE
FINE NOW IN THE FIRST STAGE OVER HERE
LET ME GIVE A COMMENT
WE ARE GOING TO LOAD OUR IMAGE AND FOR
THIS WE ARE GOING TO DEFINE A FUNCTION
LETS SAY
DEF READ FILE AND HERE WE'RE GOING TO
GIVE THE PATH
SO IT WILL LET'S SAY THIS NAME HAS FILE
NAME
ALL RIGHT AND WE'LL HAVE IMAGE SO THIS
WILL BE CV2
DOT IMREAD AND YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE A
FILE PATH
AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE IMAGE
IT'S GOING TO BE CV2
UNDERSCORE IM SHOW AND WE ARE GOING TO
PASS THE FILE NAME
OR WHAT WE CAN DO IS IF YOU WANT TO JUST
SEE THE IMAGE RIGHT I CAN JUST USE
PLT DOT I AM SHOW THEN I JUST HAVE TO
PASS THIS IMAGE
ALL RIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE PLT DOT SHOW
AND FINALLY WE SHOULD RETURN THE IMAGE
SO THIS WOULD RETURN THE BINARY PART
RETURN IMAGE
SO THIS IS ALL THERE IS SO LET ME SEE
OKAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IMAGE IT'S
GOING TO BE IMG RIGHT SO IMG
BUT BEFORE THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT
WHENEVER THE FILES ARE READ USING CV2
THEY ARE USUALLY READ INTO
BGR FORMAT WE'LL CONVERT THAT INTO RGB
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE IMAGE THEN WE HAVE
CV2
DOTS CONVERT COLOR THAT IS CVT COLOR
HERE WE'RE GONNA PASS THE IMAGE THAT I
HAVE THAT'S IMAGE
THEN WE HAVE CV2 DOT COLOR
OKAY LET ME JUST REDUCE YEAH SEE COLOR
WE WANT THIS FOR
BGR TO BINARY YEAH IT'S GONNA BE FOR RGB
RIGHT SO
R G AND B
OKAY SO THIS LOOKS GREAT AND I THINK
THIS SHOULD BE FINE
LET'S SAVE THIS AND LET'S EXECUTE THIS
OVER HERE
COOL SO NOW WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL ADD AN
IMAGE TO OUR DIRECTORY HERE LET ME
QUICKLY BROWSE GOOGLE AND ADD AN IMAGE
OVER HERE
ALL RIGHT SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAVE
LOADED MY IMAGE AND
GIVE THIS FUNCTION CALL LET'S CALL THIS
HERE
PASTE IT HERE AND LET'S SAY FILE PATH OR
FILE NAME RIGHT
SO WE'LL PASTE THIS HERE FILE NAME
AND WE'LL PASS A STRING OVER HERE SO
WE'LL JUST TAKE THIS AS THIS IS IN THE
SAME DIRECTORY WE'LL JUST SAY RELATIVE
PATH
AND PASS IT OVER HERE AND LET'S TRY TO
EXECUTE THIS LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE ARE GETTING
THIS IMAGE RIGHT BUT
NOW I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO SEE
WHAT IS THIS ARRAY HERE SO FOR THAT
THE REASON WHY WE ARE GETTING THIS ARRAY
IS BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO READ THIS IMAGE
HERE
SO IF I ADD THIS TO A CERTAIN NAME LET'S
SAY
IMAGE THEN WE WON'T BE SEEING THAT PART
OVER HERE
SO AS YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE THIS IS THE
IMAGE WHICH WE HAVE LOADED
IF YOU WANT TO TURN OFF THE ACCESS WE
CAN DO THAT AS WELL PLT DOT
ACCESS JUST PUT OFF OVER HERE
SO IF YOU WANT PLT DOT ACCESS TO BE
TURNED OFF YOU HAVE TO USE COUPLE OF
LIBRARIES
OR I SHOULD SAY A LIBRARY THAT IS VERY
SPECIFIC TO JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SO FOR THAT
REASON WE'LL JUST AVOID THIS FOR NOW
AND JUST FOCUS ON THIS PART
ALL RIGHT SO AS YOU CAN SEE OUR IMAGE IS
LOADING UP PERFECTLY FINE
SO NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE
GOING TO TRY TO CREATE A CARTOON OF THIS
AND IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO IS WELL
VERSED WITH ANIMATION YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW EDGES PLAY A PRETTY HUGE
ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO CARTOONS RIGHT
SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TRY TO
INCREASE THE EDGES OF OUR IMAGE OVER
HERE
ALL RIGHT SO FOR THIS LET'S SAY MARKDOWN
AND LET'S GIVE A NAME HERE AS CREATE
EDGE MARKS RIGHT SO CREATE
EDGE MASK
FINE SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE HAVE
SOMETHING CALLED AS ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD
IN OPENCV WHICH WOULD HELP US DO THAT SO
WE'LL DEFINE A FUNCTION HERE DEF
EDGE MARK ALL RIGHT AND THIS SHOULD TAKE
INPUT AS IN IMAGE THEN WE HAVE LINE SIZE
THAT IS THE SIZE THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE
FOR YOUR MASK AND BLUR
VALUE OKAY SO
FIRST OFF WE'LL CONVERT OUR IMAGE FROM
RGB TO GRAY
WE HAVE CV2 DOT CVT COLOR
FIRST OFF IMAGE THE ONE THAT WE ARE
GOING TO PASS
THEN WE HAVE CV2 DOT
CV OKAY LET ME JUST GO CAPS
COLOR RGB TO GRAY
ALL RIGHT THIS LOOKS GREAT AND NOW WHAT
WE'LL DO IS WE'LL SAY
GRAY BLUR SO CV2
DOT MEDIAN BLUR WE ARE GOING TO USE
THE OUR GRAY IMAGE ALL RIGHT AND THEN
ALSO PASS THE BLUR VALUE OKAY
AND NOW WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TAKE THE
EDGES HERE
SO FOR THIS WE HAVE CV2 NOT ADAPTIVE
THRESHOLD
ALL RIGHT GUYS SO WITHIN THIS UH THIS
TAKES UP COUPLE OF PARAMETERS THE FIRST
ONE OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE
THE IMAGE SO IT'S GOING TO BE GREY BLUR
SO LET ME
COPY THIS FROM HERE MEANWHILE LET ME
ALSO JUST CHANGE THIS VALUE
ALL RIGHT AND LET ME COPY THIS FROM HERE
AND PASTE IT HERE
ALL RIGHT AND THEN WE'LL GIVE 255 THAT'S
ADAPTIVE METHOD AND THEN
WE ALSO HAVE THIS BUILT-IN FUNCTION CV2
DOT
ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD MEAN
OKAY AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE
BINARY CV2 DOT
THRESHOLD BINARY AND THEN FINALLY WE
HAVE LINE SIZE THIS IS THE
PARAMETER THAT WE ARE GOING TO GIVE OUT
THAT IS THE THICKNESS OF THE
EDGES SO LET'S GIVE THAT AS WELL LINE
SIZE
AND THEN BLUR VALUE ALL RIGHT
SO THIS IS ALL THERE IS OVER HERE AND
FINALLY OKAY LET ME JUST DROP THIS DOWN
SO THAT IT'S EASIER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND
AND FOLLOW UP
ALL RIGHT AND NOW THIS THING WILL RETURN
JUST THE EDGES OKAY
EDGES I WILL COPY THE EDGES FROM HERE
SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS THING IS DOING IS
THIS IS TAKING IN THE GRAY SCALE LET ME
GIVE A COMMENT SO HERE
SO THIS TAKES IN GRAYSCALE IMAGE
AND OUTPUT OUTPUT HERE IS GOING TO BE
JUST THE
EDGES RIGHT
ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN HERE LET ME RUN THIS OFF
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
RUN THIS AND NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS
CALL THIS FUNCTION ALL RIGHT WE HAVE TO
CALL THIS FUNCTION SO LET ME COPY THIS
FROM HERE
AND PASTE IT ALL RIGHT AND NOW WE NEED
THE LINE SIZE
AND THE BLUR VALUE SO LET'S SAY LINE
SIZE WILL GIVE HERE AS
FIVE PIXELS YOU CAN GIVE ANY VALUE THAT
YOU WANT AND LET ME GIVE FOR BLUR VALUE
ALSO AS
SEVEN SEVEN AND SEVEN EITHER WAY IT
DOESN'T MATTER
AND THE IMAGE OVER HERE IS GONNA BE THIS
ONE RIGHT SO OUR INPUT IMAGE
ALL RIGHT SO HERE I HAVE DONE A SMALL
MISTAKE IT'S NOT A GRAYSCALE IMAGE THIS
IS GOING TO BE
INPUT IMAGE ALL RIGHT WE ARE DONE WITH
THIS
LET ME RUN THIS AS WELL SO AS YOU CAN
SEE THIS RETURNS AS ONE
MATRIX WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I LET'S
PLOT HOW DOES THIS LOOKS LIKE
SO LET'S SAY EDGES IS EQUAL TO THIS AND
LET'S TRY TO PLOT THIS OFF
PLT DOT IM SHOW EDGES
ALL RIGHT AND THEN PLT DOT SHOW
SO AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
GETTING HERE IF YOU WANT ME TO ENHANCE
THIS LIKE WHAT I CAN DO IS C
MAP IS EQUAL TO GRAY
OKAY THAT'S BECAUSE WE GAVE THIS AS AN
UPPERCASE LET'S RUN THIS AGAIN
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE JUST THE
EDGES RIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE THICKNESS OF
THIS IT'S PRETTY EASY WE JUST HAVE TO
CHANGE THE LINE SIZE LET'S SAY 5 PIXELS
AND NOW SEE
THE THICKNESS HAS REDUCED ALL RIGHT AND
WE CAN ALSO GIVE C MAP IS EQUAL TO
BINARY
NOW YOU'LL SEE A BLACK IMAGE WITH A
BLACK BACKGROUND WE HAVE JUST WHITE ONES
SO EVEN THIS IS FINE EITHER WAY IT
DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT BECAUSE
THIS IS THE OUTPUT THAT WE HAVE SHOWING
OVER HERE OKAY SO NOW THAT WE HAVE GOT
THE UH IMAGES
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS REDUCE THE
COLOR PALETTE SO WHAT DOES THIS COLOR
PALETTE MEAN LET ME SCROLL UP
SO AS YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE WE HAVE
MULTIPLE COLORS HERE
NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I DON'T WANT
ALL OF THESE COLORS LET'S SAY I WANT TO
FOCUS ON JUST
YOU KNOW JUST THREE COLORS OR SO SO
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO HERE
LET'S SAY LET ME GIVE A COMMENT HERE
REDUCE THE COLOR PALETTE
AND LET ME REDUCE THIS AS WELL OKAY
SO NOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS I
MENTIONED EARLIER WE JUST WANT TO REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF COLORS THAT WE ARE TRYING
TO USE HERE
SO EVEN FOR THIS WE ARE GOING TO WRITE A
FUNCTION THAT IS DEF
COLOR QUANTIZATION AND THIS TAKES IN THE
INPUT THAT IS THE IMAGE
AND THEN LET'S SAY WE'LL DEFINE A
VARIABLE HERE CALLED AS K
OR C ANY VARIABLE THAT YOU CAN TAKE AND
THIS BASICALLY REFERS TO YOU KNOW HOW
MANY NUMBER OF COLORS YOU WANT TO
SHOW SO FIRST OFF WE'LL TRANSFORM THE
IMAGE SO
FIRST OFF THAT WILL BE TRANSFORM THE
IMAGE
WHAT THIS MEANS IS UH WE'LL TRY TO
RESHAPE THIS OFF
SO WE'LL HAVE DATA IS EQUAL TO NP DOT
FLOAT
AND WE'RE GONNA PASS IMAGE HERE THIS IS
GONNA BE THE INPUT IMAGE
RIGHT AND THEN WE'LL JUST RESHAPE MINUS
ONE COMMA THREE
THEN LET'S DETERMINE THE CRITERIA
AND HERE WE'LL HAVE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE
CV2 DOT
TERM CRITERIA
ALL RIGHT PLUS CV2
SORRY THIS IS GOING TO BE LOWERCASE CV2
DOT TERM CRITERIA MAX ITERATOR
ALL RIGHT AND NOW WE'LL GIVE 20 HERE
AND THEN 0.01 THIS LOOKS GREAT
AND NOW FINALLY WE ARE GOING TO
IMPLEMENT HERE K MEANS CLUSTERING RIGHT
OKAY SO WE HAVE RET THEN WE HAVE LABEL
AND THEN CENTER SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS CV2
DOT K MEANS WE'RE GONNA PASS DATA HERE
AND THEN WE NEED THE NUMBER OF CENTROIDS
THAT IS K
THEN WE NEED THE LABEL SO THAT IS NONE
OVER HERE THEN WE HAVE THE CRITERIA THAT
WE WANT
LET ME JUST COPY THIS FROM HERE AND ADD
IT HERE
AND THEN WE'LL SAY 10 AND THEN WE'LL
HAVE CB2 DOT
LIKE RANDOM K MEANS RIGHT SO C V TWO DOT
K MEANS RANDOM CLUSTERS RANDOM CENTERS
OKAY SO BASICALLY WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO
HAVE A MACHINE LEARNING OVER HERE
PART OF IT ALL RIGHT SO NOW WE'LL HAVE
CENTERS
LET'S SAY CENTER WE HAVE CENTER IS EQUAL
TO
NP DOT UNIT THAT'S UNIT 8 LET'S SAY YEAH
AND THEN WE'LL JUST PASS CENTER HERE ALL
RIGHT
AND FINALLY A RESULT IS EQUAL TO CENTER
WHEREIN I HAVE LABEL DOT FLATTEN
AND PASS THIS OFF SO FINALLY RESULT
IS EQUAL TO RESULT DOT RESHAPE
IMAGE SHAPE AND THIS WOULD RETURN THE
RESULT
SO THAT MEANS WE DO NOT HAVE ANY
SYNTACTICAL ERROR AS I HAVE WRITTEN THIS
UH AS I HAVE TRIED TO EXECUTE THIS ALL
RIGHT SO NOW WHAT WE'LL DO
WE'LL LET'S SAY LET'S TAKE UP AN IMAGE
LET'S SAY
IMG THIS WILL BE COLOR QUANTIZATION WE
I'LL BASICALLY TRY TO CALL THIS FUNCTION
AND NOW HERE K RIGHT WE JUST WANT NUMBER
OF DOMINANT COLOR LET'S SAY INSTEAD OF
MINI WE'LL JUST GIVE TWO OKAY THIS HAS
RAN SUCCESSFULLY
LET'S TRY TO UH PLOT THIS UP AND LET'S
SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO WE'LL
HAVE PLT DOT I AM SURE INSTEAD OF THAT
LET'S COPY THIS FROM HERE
RIGHT SO PLT DOT IM SHOW LET ME COPY IT
FROM HERE
AND PASTE IT AND HERE WE WON'T BE HAVING
BINARY
INSTEAD WE'LL JUST HAVE IMAGE
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE JUST TWO OF
THE MOST PROMINENT COLORS RIGHT
NOW LET'S SAY I JUST WANT THREE COLORS
AND NOW IF I EXECUTE THIS OKAY IT'S NOT
SHOWING ME HERE LET'S SAY
I WANT FIVE COLORS OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE
DIFFERENT PROMINENT COLORS
WHAT HAPPENS LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF I
JUST GIVE ONE RIGHT LET'S LET'S HAVE A
LOOK INTO THIS
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE JUST HAVE ONE
PROMINENT COLOR HERE
ALL RIGHT SO REASON WHY WE ARE GETTING
THIS ERROR RIGHT LIKE THE REASON WHY WE
ARE NOT GETTING
THE CHANGES IN THE COLOR IS BECAUSE OF
MY FAULT WHAT I'VE DONE IS WE ARE TRYING
TO CHANGE THE COLOR RIGHT AND WE ARE
GIVING THE SAME NAME OVER HERE
SO WHAT WE'LL DO INSTEAD OF GIVING THE
SAME NAME WE'LL SAY
IMAGE QUANTIZE ALL RIGHT IMAGE QUANTIZE
AND LET'S TRY TO RERUN EVERYTHING FROM
THE START
OKAY SO AS YOU CAN SEE NOW WE'LL JUST WE
JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT ARE THE PROMINENT
TWO COLORS LET'S TRY TO DO THAT
OKAY SO AS YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE THE
PROMINENT TWO COLORS THAT WE HAVE
RIGHT THE GREEN AND THE GRAY ONES ALL
RIGHT SO THIS IS ALL THERE IS ABOUT YOU
KNOW
QUANTIZATION OF A COLOR SO WHAT WE'LL DO
NOW IN THE NEXT STAGE
WE'RE GOING TO MERGE WHATEVER THE IMAGE
THAT WE HAVE QUANTIZED RIGHT LIKE THE
LIMITED NUMBER OF IMAGES
AND THEN THESE BOUNDARIES OKAY AND LET'S
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
THAT IS LET ME GIVE A COMMENT HERE YOU
KNOW COMBINE
EDGE MASK WITH
THE QUANTIZED COLOR OKAY THAT IS
QUANTIZED IMAGE OVER HERE
OKAY BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT WE'LL DO IS
LET'S TRY TO ADD UP A FILTER JUST SO
THAT WE REDUCE SOME MORE NOISE SO LET ME
GIVE
THAT AS A COMMENT HERE LET'S SAY WE WANT
TO REDUCE THE NOISE
SO IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE NOISE WE'RE
GOING TO PASS THIS THROUGH A FILTER
LET'S SAY WE HAVE
THIS BLURRED RIGHT SO BLU R E D LET'S
SAY BLURRED THEN WE HAVE THIS FILTER CV2
DOT
BILATERAL FILTER OKAY BILATERAL FILTER
AND NOW WE JUST HAVE TO PASS THE IMAGE
THAT IS THE IMAGE THAT HAS BEEN
QUANTIZED
THEN WE HAVE D IS EQUAL TO 7 D HERE IS
NOTHING BUT DIAMETER OF EACH PIXEL SO
THAT'S GONNA BE SEVEN AND THEN WE HAVE
SIGMA COLOR
SO LET'S GIVE THIS AS 200 AND THEN WE
HAVE SIGMA SPACE
I WILL GIVE EVEN THIS AS 200 OVER HERE
AND NOW WHAT WE'LL DO LET'S TRY TO PLOT
THIS AS WELL
LET ME GET THIS AND PLOT IT OVER HERE
AND WE JUST NEED TO SEE HOW THIS WOULD
LOOK LIKE WE'LL COPY THIS
AND PASTE IT OVER HERE SO AS YOU CAN SEE
OUR IMAGE IS SUBSTANTIALLY BLURRED UP
RIGHT SO COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS OVER
HERE
ALL RIGHT SO IN THE NEXT STAGE AS I
MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE GOING TO
COMBINE
THE EDGE MASK WITH THE QUANTIZES IMAGE
RIGHT SO WE ARE GOING TO COMBINE THIS
WITH OUR EDGES OVER HERE SO LET'S WRITE
A FUNCTION FOR THAT
OKAY INSTEAD OF WRITING A FUNCTION WE
CAN JUST DIRECTLY PASS THIS THROUGH HERE
OR YOU CAN ALSO WRITE
THE FUNCTION SO YOU KNOW LET'S SAY DEF
CARTOON
ALL RIGHT AND THIS THING WHAT IT DO IT
WOULD DO IS IT TAKES TWO PARAMETERS
OKAY OR LET'S SAY IT WOULD JUST TAKE
THIS BLURRED IMAGE PARAMETER RIGHT SO IT
WILL JUST TAKE THIS PARAMETER HERE
BLURRED AND LET ME PASTE IT OVER HERE SO
FOR THIS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS
LET'S SAY WE HAVE C
THEN WE HAVE CV2 DOT BITWISE AND
AND THIS WOULD JUST LIKE END UP THIS
VALUE
BLURRED LET ME COPY THIS FROM HERE
AND THEN WE NEED MASK EDGES RIGHT SO WE
COPY THIS
AND WE ALSO HAVE THIS MASK RIGHT SO MASK
SO THIS WOULD BE THE EDGES VALUE AND THE
EDGES VALUE IS SOMEWHERE OVER HERE
ON TOP THIS VALUE RIGHT SO THIS IS EDGES
SO LET ME COPY THE EDGES HERE
AND LET ME PASTE IT HERE ALL RIGHT AND
WHAT
THIS FUNCTION WILL DO IS THIS WOULD BE
LIKE PLT DOT PLOT
SORRY IT'S GOING TO BE I AM SURE WE'RE
GOING TO SHOW C
AND THEN PLT DOT SHOW
WE'LL DO ONE THING LET'S NOT SEND ANY
PARAMETER HERE WE'LL JUST
LET IT BE THE WAY IT IS AND NOW ALL WE
NEED TO DO IS HAVE A FUNCTION CALL
LET'S SAY JUST CARTOON AND LET'S SEE
WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE TRIED TO
CREATE A CARTOON IMAGE OF THIS
SO LET'S GIVE SOME MORE TRIAL HERE
INSTEAD OF THIS
LET'S TRY REDUCING THIS TO THREE AND LET
ME
CHANGE THIS FROM K TWO TO NINE AND LET
ME RE-EXECUTE THIS AND LET'S SEE WHAT
HAPPENS
OKAY SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE ARE
GETTING SOME OF THE DOMINANT OTHER
COLORS
AND LET'S NOW SEE HOW THIS CARTOON WOULD
LOOK LIKE YES SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE
WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE CARTOON UNIFIED
VERSION OF THIS RIGHT
SO LET ME PLOT THIS SIDE BY SIDE LET'S
ALSO SEE THE ORIGINAL IMAGE
FOR THAT WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL DO A SMALL
CHANGE THAT IS
ALL RIGHT WE'LL TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
HERE
AND FINALLY LET'S TRY TO PLOT THIS UP
OKAY SO WE'LL ALSO TRY TO PLOT OUR
ORIGINAL IMAGE SO LET ME COPY THIS
AND WRITE ONE MORE FUNCTION OKAY AND
LET'S EXECUTE THIS
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS IS OUR
ORIGINAL IMAGE LET ME ZOOM OUT
UH BEFORE THAT LET ME ALSO GIVE THIS
THING HERE TITLE PLT DOT TITLE
ORIGINAL IMAGE AND THIS IS GONNA BE
CARTOONIFIED IMAGE RIGHT SO
AND LET'S TRY TO RE RUN THIS AND LET'S
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE ORIGINAL
IMAGE AND THE CARD UNIFIED IMAGE
LET'S TRY DOING THIS WITH SOME OTHER
IMAGES
LET ME TAKE COUPLE MORE IMAGES FROM
GOOGLE AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
ALRIGHT GUYS SO LET'S TRY TO LOAD
ANOTHER IMAGE LET ME JUST COME HERE
WE HAVE THIS ANOTHER IMAGE HERE LET ME
COPY THE RELATIVE PATH
AND LET ME ADD THIS PATH OVER HERE ALL
RIGHT AND LET ME RUN
ALL AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO THIS
IS OUR ORIGINAL IMAGE
LET'S SEE THE ORIGINAL AND EVERYTHING AT
THE END
SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE TRIED TO
BLURRED AND WE ARE TRYING TO CARTOONY
FIVE
YOU KNOW THE IMAGES THAT WE HAVE WELL
YOU CAN DO SOME MORE MODIFICATIONS YOU
CAN INCREASE THE THICKNESS OF YOUR LINE
AND UH THAT WOULD EVEN MORE ENHANCE THE
LOOK AND FEEL OF YOUR
OF YOUR IMAGE SO LET'S SAY I WANT TO
CHANGE THIS FROM FIVE LET'S SAY EIGHT
AND EVEN THIS LET'S SAY EIGHT AND TRY TO
RUN ALL OF THIS
FROM THE START
OKAY THE REASON WHY WE ARE GETTING THIS
ERROR IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RUN THIS
FROM THE START RIGHT SO LET ME
JUST RESTART THIS KERNEL AND RUN IT ALL
AGAIN OKAY
AND THIS VALUE WOULD RANGE FROM SEVEN
COMMA SEVEN ALL RIGHT AND LET'S TRY TO
JUST RERUN THIS AND RUN ALL
OKAY SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE ARE
GETTING THIS IMAGE
UH THIS IS THE ORIGINAL IMAGE THE WAY IT
IS AND THEN WE TRY TO CARTONIFY IT AND
THIS IS HOW IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
WELL YOU CAN MODIFY THIS IN YOUR OWN WAY
AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF ICEBERG THAT
YOU CAN DO WITH OPENCV
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY UH IF YOU
HAVE PERFORMED ANY IMPROVEMENTS YOU KNOW
YOU CAN DEFINITELY
PROVIDE YOUR GITHUB LINK IN THE COMMENT
